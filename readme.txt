What else can you do with Node Packages?
    Among many uses, Node can be used for traditional websites and back-end API services.

What else can you do with Express? 
    Execute any code.
    Make changes to the request and the response objects.
    End the request-response cycle.
    Call the next middleware function in the stack.

What other technologies could you use instead of Express?
    hapi, connect, socket.io, sockjs, pug, mongodb, jedis, etc.

How is hosting in Express different than how you've hosted before?
    I've only done basic personal websites that were hosted by Geocities 
    & other free web hosting sites. Express has access  to many packages 
    to address almost any web development problems. Websites can be more 
    interactive and feature intensive with Express.
